# Polarized ⁶,⁷Li @ EIC — Simulation Program Plans

Demonstrate feasibility and showcase the physics a polarized lithium source
brings to the EIC, in support of the ANL polarized ⁶,⁷Li ion-source program
(`docs/ecrp_2026_proposal.pdf`, NOFO DE-FOA-0003602).

## Document map

| doc | content |
|---|---|
| [01_findings_physics_case.md](01_findings_physics_case.md) | What the source docs + literature establish: the three flagship observables (gluonometry Δ, tensor b₁, polarized EMC), formulas, beam parameters, polarization inputs |
| [02_phase1_event_generation.md](02_phase1_event_generation.md) | Phase 1: fast simulation + BeAGLE — phase space, rates, FOMs, spectator-tagging purity. Step-by-step with effort estimates |
| [03_phase2_full_simulation.md](03_phase2_full_simulation.md) | Phase 2: full ePIC chain (eic-shell → npsim → EICrecon) — far-forward acceptance for Li fragments, reconstructed-level closure tests |
| [04_open_questions.md](04_open_questions.md) | External dependencies: ring spin dynamics, optics for Li, BeAGLE validity, theory curves — each with owner and default assumption |

## The physics in three lines

1. **⁶Li (spin-1)** = practical replacement for polarized deuterons (which
   the EIC ring likely cannot keep polarized): tensor structure function b₁
   and the purely gluonic double-helicity-flip Δ(x,Q²) ("nuclear
   gluonometry"), plus medium modification via ⁶Li-vs-d comparison.
2. **⁷Li (spin-3/2)** = effective polarized proton in-medium (P_p ≈ 0.86):
   the polarized EMC effect over an order of magnitude more x–Q² than JLab,
   discriminating mean-field vs SRC origins of the EMC effect.
3. **Collider-mode spectator tagging** (α, t, n in Roman Pots/OMD/B0/ZDC)
   selects the struck cluster — impossible in fixed-target; its purity is
   the simulation deliverable the ECRP proposal explicitly calls for.

## Strategic findings from the verified research sweep (2026-06-12)

1. **Four confirmed literature gaps we can publish first**: b₁ for any
   A > 2 nucleus; any numerical EIC gluonometry (Δ) projection; α-tagged
   DIS on ⁶Li; a Li-beam luminosity/polarization parameter set.
2. **Tagging inverts between isotopes at IP6** (rigidity-verified): ⁷Li
   α-tag lands mid-Roman-Pot window (works); ⁶Li α-tag is beam-blind below
   the RP pT cutoff (needs the pT tail, p/³He channels, or IR-8 secondary
   focus); tritons have no IP6 coverage at all. ⁷Li — the isotope the
   source commissions first — is also the tagging-friendly one.
3. **No generator anywhere does polarized nuclei** — asymmetry reweighting
   on unpolarized samples (BeAGLE for breakup) is the established route;
   BeAGLE runs A = 6,7 but untuned (C-12 Fermi momentum, no cluster
   geometry) → validation + cluster-IA cross-check is mandatory.
4. **Machine feasibility is already argued in EPIOS** (arXiv:2510.10794,
   PRC 113:060501): G(⁶Li) = −0.178 handled deuteron-like, G(⁷Li) = +1.532
   with partial snakes; ~138/~117 GeV/u top energies.
5. **Calendar anchor**: INT program on polarized ion beams at EIC,
   March 22 – April 2, 2027 — target for Phase-1 money plots.

## Development run 2 (2026-06-12, autonomous; commits abd2bce…)

- ☑ Money plots on real PDF grids (CT18/NNPDFpol): gluonometry 5σ at
  Δ/F₁=10⁻³ within 25–37 fb⁻¹/u; conclusions stable vs toys.
- ☑ Control studies on **official BeAGLE samples** (xrootd-streamed):
  routing validated at all three regions — e+d p→OMD 96.6%, e+d n→ZDC
  99.2%, e+³He p→RP 99.8%; BeAGLE pT tails 2–13× harder than the cluster
  model ⇒ R≈1 tag acceptances are model-dominated (the ⁶Li α-tag number).
- ☑ Far-forward gun scan in **current epic-main geometry** (18×275
  fields): routing table confirmed by Geant4; RP stations now at
  z=32.5/34.3 m; **discovery — the "no-coverage" triton (R=1.286)
  crosses the RP planes on the over-rigid side + showers in the ZDC ⇒
  the ⁷Li α+t double-tag may work at IP6** (10σ/reco check pending).
- ☑ Container refreshed (eic_xl, EICrecon v1.38.0); known issue: its
  pyHepMC3 rootIO segfaults — HepMC3 reading stays on the legacy image.
- ❌ Showstopper for local BeAGLE generation: **FLUKA license** (user
  registration at fluka.org) — everything else is built and validated.

## Current status (2026-06-12, end of first development sprint)

- ☑ Source docs digested; verified findings + benchmarks table in 01.
- ☑ Phase-1 fast-sim developed and tested (15 tests): rates/FOM maps,
  **first tagging-acceptance numbers** (⁷Li α→RP 96–99%; ⁶Li α 3–9% at
  IP6 — quantitative beam-blindness), **first money plots** for all three
  observables (gluonometry 5σ at Δ/F₁=10⁻³ within ~15–40 fb⁻¹/u;
  CBT-vs-TMT ≈5σ at high x with 100 fb⁻¹/u), estimator closure tests,
  and PDF-grid backends (CT18NLO, NNPDFpol11) behind the toy interfaces.
  See `../fastsim/README.md` for the headline numbers and caveats.
- ☑ Local stack surveyed: BeAGLE present but needs FLUKA (use BNL/JLab
  prebuilds); eic-shell container runnable but stale (image renamed
  `eic_xl`; current releases epic 26.06.0, EICrecon v1.38.0) → reinstall
  at Phase-2 start.
- ☐ Next actions (cheapest-first): ask Cloët about the ⁶Li
  effective-polarization convention (factor 2.4 in the g₁ FOM, plans/04
  item 6); request SDCC/ifarm access + email BeAGLE authors (long pole,
  plans/02 step 1.5); adopt EPIOS scenario numbers and digitized
  CBT/TMT/b₁ theory curves (steps 1.1–1.2); then rerun money plots on
  grid inputs.
