# Open Questions & External Dependencies

Items that gate or shape the simulation program but are *not* solvable
inside it. Each has an owner-to-engage and a default assumption we proceed
with until answered. Updated 2026-06-12 after the fetch-verified literature
sweep — several items moved from "unknown" to "answered, needs adoption".

## Answered by the literature sweep (adopt, then verify with owners)

A1. **Ring spin dynamics for Li** — EPIOS white paper (arXiv:2510.10794,
    PRC 113:060501, Table 3): G(⁶Li) = −0.178 with 81 linear resonances to
    top energy, handled like the deuteron (15 Tm solenoid partial snake +
    jump quads; AGS crossing only imperfection resonances); G(⁷Li) = +1.532,
    573 resonances, partial snakes keeping spin tune 0.2–0.8 + jump quads.
    Top energies ~138 (⁶Li) / ~117 (⁷Li) GeV/u. Deuteron antecedent: Huang
    et al. PRAB 23:021001. *Remaining question:* polarization-survival
    fraction through the full chain (not in any paper) → keep FOMs
    parameterized in P.
A2. **Why ³He is quoted at 166 GeV/u in old documents** — eRHIC-era
    250-GeV-proton rigidity legacy (Milner arXiv:1809.05626). Current design
    number is 183 GeV/u = ⅔ × 275 with 6-snake spin preservation (CDR
    Sec. 5.5; eic.jlab.org/Requirements). Li rigidity scaling (137.5/117.9
    GeV/u) therefore stands, pending C-AD blessing of Li specifically.
A3. **Far-forward routing of Li fragments** — verified windows (plans/03
    §2.2): ⁷Li α → Roman Pots (R = 0.86); tritons → **no IP6 coverage**
    (R > 1, both beams); ⁶Li α/d → beam-blind below RP pT cutoff (R = 1.0);
    p → OMD; n/γ → ZDC. IR-8 secondary focus (RPs 44–45.5 m) recovers R ≈ 1
    at pT → 0. *Remaining question:* none at concept level — quantitative
    acceptance is exactly Phase-2 step 2.2.
A4. **BeAGLE status for light nuclei** — runs any (A,Z) but A>4 uses the
    C-12 Fermi-momentum parameterization, Woods–Saxon geometry without
    α+d/α+t clustering, FLUKA evaporation untuned for A<12, code frozen
    since 2023, FLUKA license required (prebuilt at BNL/JLab/CVMFS).
    *Remaining question (Q7 below):* is the collaboration maintaining it /
    can we get light-ion guidance?

## Still open — machine / accelerator

1. **Polarization survival through EBIS charge-breeding + ring for Li.**
   Explicitly "a goal of the study rather than a promised outcome" in the
   ECRP proposal; no number exists anywhere.
   *Engage:* EPIOS (Raparia, Rathmann), MIT ³He group (Milner).
   *Default:* P_z = 0.7 at IP, band {0.5, 0.9}.
2. **Transverse ion polarization at IP6 for Li.** Gluonometry needs
   transverse spin with unpolarized electrons. HSR stable direction is
   vertical (transverse) in the arcs — possibly the *easy* orientation —
   but the IP6 rotator/snake configuration for Li species is undefined.
   Also: clean b₁ extraction prefers polarization along the momentum
   transfer (Cosyn et al. arXiv:2410.12764) — a spin-direction systematic
   to design for.
   *Engage:* C-AD spin group via EPIOS; INT program (Mar 22–Apr 2, 2027).
   *Default:* transverse running available with P = P_z value.
3. **Tensor (λ=0) bunch operations.** Source RF transitions can prepare
   m = 0 (proposal Sec. 3.5); unknowns: survival through acceleration,
   bunch-by-bunch spin patterns, relative-luminosity control at 10⁻⁴.
   *Default:* equal thirds (+,0,−), δ(rel-lumi) as a Phase-2 systematic.
4. **Li luminosity.** Confirmed gap — no Li number exists in any document
   (EPIOS included). Space charge, IBS, cooling for Li bunches unstudied.
   *Engage:* EPIOS/C-AD. *Default:* 10 fb⁻¹/nucleon per setting, quoted
   ∈ {1, 10, 100}.
5. **Li ring polarimetry.** EPIOS concept: Li–Li elastic CNI vs polarized
   Li jet (HJET analog) + Breit–Rabi absolute; analyzing-power theory
   flagged as needing work. R&D scale in EPIOS: ~26 FTE-yr/12 yr.
   *Default:* δP/P = 3% systematic in FOMs.

## Still open — generator / theory

6. **⁶Li effective-polarization convention** (factor 2.4 in the g₁ FOM):
   slides' P_p = P_n = 1/3 (per-nucleon-normalized) vs cluster-model
   whole-nucleus ≈ 0.81 (= 0.87 P_d × 0.93 D-state). ⁷Li is settled:
   P_p = +0.866, P_n = −0.037.
   *Engage:* I. Cloët (ANL, local). *Default in code:* 1/3 (conservative),
   switch after resolution.
7. **BeAGLE light-ion guidance / maintenance.** See A4.
   *Engage:* M. Baker, A. Jentsch, Z. Tu, W. Chang.
   *Fallback:* cluster-IA toy fragmenter (Phase-1 step 1.5.3).
8. **Nuclear (n)PDFs at A = 6,7.** EPPS21/nNNPDF coverage to confirm;
   polarized nuclear PDFs don't exist → effective-polarization convolution
   + CBT/TMT medium curves as scenarios.
9. **b₁ and Δ theory for ⁶Li specifically.** Confirmed literature gaps:
   no b₁ prediction for any A > 2; no EIC Δ projection for any target.
   First-mover opportunity — co-author with theory.
   *Engage:* Cloët (ANL), Cosyn, Miller; lattice: Detmold/Shanahan.
10. **Radiative corrections on tensor observables** (A_zz, cos 2φ).
    Vector-case tools exist (DJANGOH/HERACLES); tensor RC uncharted.
    *Default:* RC band from vector-case studies (Phase-1 step 1.4).

## Still open — detector / software

11. **Far-forward transfer matrices & optics at Li rigidities** (RP/OMD
    reconstruction in EICrecon is tuned per beam setting).
    *Engage:* ePIC FF WG (A. Jentsch). Phase-2 step 2.2.
12. **Geant4/DD4hep light-ion & excited-ion primaries** (10LZZZAAAI codes
    from BeAGLE; DD4hep had fixes ~PR #920; `sanitize_hepmc3.py` exists).
    Verify in Phase-2 step 2.1.4.
13. **Afterburner + beamline configs for Li** — verified absent; three
    concrete artifacts to add (EicConfigurator.cc preset; beamline_*.xml;
    BeAGLE runcard). ⁶Li can start from He-4/deuteron files (same Z/A).
