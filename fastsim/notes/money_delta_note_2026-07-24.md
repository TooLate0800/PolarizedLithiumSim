# Money-Δ Plot: Sum-Rule-Constrained Analysis — 2026-07-24

**Observable.** 5σ discovery luminosity `L_5σ` (fb⁻¹/nucleon) and fractional
asymmetry uncertainty `δA/A` for the `cos(2φ)` double-helicity-flip tensor
asymmetry on transversely tensor-polarized ⁶Li. The new element today is
sum-rule-constrained normalization of Δ(x, Q²): instead of scanning an
arbitrary peak `Δ/F₁` scale, the amplitude A is derived from the physical
first-moment constraint `∫x·Δ dx = c·α_s(Q²)`. This reduces the normalization
ambiguity from order-of-magnitude to a factor-of-order-2 shape systematic,
transforming the reach picture from "requires a decade" to
"systematics-limited within a year."

**Revision history**

- 2026-07-24 (initial): First session with sum-rule-constrained Δ normalization.
  Script `money_delta_20260724.py` (1346 lines); 9 PNGs in `fastsim/out/money_delta/`.
  See also: `money_delta_note_2026-07-16.md`, `2026-07-20.md`, `2026-07-21.md` for
  prior work and the evolving next-steps ranking.
- 2026-07-24 (extension): Corrected plot x-axis convention on Plots 1-4. The x-axis is
  now peak Δ/F₁ (not the raw `scale` parameter s). Vertical dashed lines are now drawn
  at the converted values peak(Δ/F₁)_bag ≈ 1.6×10⁻² and peak(Δ/F₁)_lat ≈ 1.2×10⁻²
  using the mid_x reference shape at ⟨Q²⟩ = 7.4 GeV². SCALES internally covers the
  code range [5e-3, 0.6] corresponding to peak Δ/F₁ ∈ [3e-4, 3e-2]. See new §4.1 for
  details. The reach numbers (L_5σ, δA/A, etc.) are unchanged — this is purely a
  visualization/labeling correction.
- 2026-07-24 (extension 2): Widened plotted x-axis range on Plots 1-4 from peak Δ/F₁ ∈ [3×10⁻⁴, 3×10⁻²] to [10⁻³, 10⁻¹] (three decades). Internal SCALES updated from [5×10⁻³, 0.6] to [0.02, 2.0]. Vertical dashed lines (bag at 1.6×10⁻², lattice at 1.2×10⁻²) unchanged. Reach numbers unchanged.
- 2026-07-24 (extension 3): Added §4.2 (statistical derivation and interpretation) explaining: origin of δA_bin = √(2/N_bin)/P_zz from cos(2φ) ML fit, combined uncertainty as one-parameter Fisher fit giving σ = ŝ/δŝ, why per-bin |δA/A| can be 10³ while combined is 10⁻² (Fisher additivity), and the σ ↔ δA/A duality (σ = 5 ↔ δA/A = 20%).
- 2026-07-24 (extension 4): Added §4.2.5 (References) listing pedagogical sources for the statistical framework used in §4.2: Cowan's Statistical Data Analysis, PDG Statistics chapter, Poskanzer-Voloshin flow-methodology paper (source of √(2/N) cos-fit uncertainty), Voloshin-Zhang (non-uniform acceptance extension), HERMES b₁ analysis (direct experimental precedent for tensor DIS asymmetry), and Lyons on the 5σ convention.
- 2026-07-24 (extension 5): Added Eq. (11) to §4 — the analytic rescaling formula σ²(s,L) = σ²_ref · (s/S₀)² · L that lets the plotting code compute δA/A at any (scale, luminosity) from a single reference sig² evaluation per (config, shape).

## 2. Key formulas

### Δ model

    Δ(x, Q²) = scale · α_s(Q²) · F₁(x, Q²) · x^α · (1−x)^β          (1)

The α_s(Q²) prefactor is new relative to prior scripts. It encodes that Δ arises
at one-gluon-exchange order in the bag model (Sather–Schmidt) or from a
two-gluon operator (gluonic probe language).

### Sum-rule constraint

    ∫₀¹ x · Δ(x, Q²) dx = c · α_s(Q²)                                 (2)

    c = −0.012   (bag model, Sather–Schmidt)
    c = −0.009   (lattice QCD, Detmold–Shanahan)

### α_s cancellation — solving for A

Substituting (1) into (2):

    scale · α_s · ∫₀¹ x · F₁(x, ⟨Q²⟩) · x^α · (1−x)^β dx = c · α_s

    ⟹  A ≡ scale = c / ∫₀¹ x · F₁(x, ⟨Q²⟩) · x^α · (1−x)^β dx      (3)

α_s cancels between numerator and denominator. A is a single constant across
all Q² bins; it is computed per-bin using the `parton` package α_s table, then
averaged. The ~5% variation of A across configs is the residual from F₁
evolution only (see §4, point 3).

### Asymmetry amplitude per bin

    A_cos2φ(x, Q², y) = −[(1−y)/y²] · Δ / [F₁ + ((1−y)/(xy²))·F₂]   (4)

### Per-bin statistical uncertainty

    δA_bin = √(2/N_bin) / P_zz                                         (5)

### Combined significance

    σ² = Σ_bins  A_cos2φ,bin² · P_zz² · N_bin / 2                     (6)

    equivalently:  σ² = Σ_bins (A_bin / δA_bin)²

### Fractional precision and discovery luminosity

    δA/A = 1/√σ²  =  1/N_σ                                             (7)

    L_5σ = 25 / (σ²/L)   at reference luminosity L                     (8)

    (δA/A)_{5σ} = 1/5 = 0.20   (definitional, N_σ = 5)                 (9)

### Luminosity scale reference (from 2026-07-20)

    L_inst = 10⁻⁶ fb⁻¹/nucleon/s = 3.6 pb⁻¹/nucleon/hour

    10  fb⁻¹/nucleon  ≈ 1 year at nominal EIC instantaneous luminosity
    100 fb⁻¹/nucleon  ≈ 10 years

## 3. A-value table

α_s cancels in equation (3); A is determined by the shape integral over F₁.
Entries below are per-config, per-shape averages from the `parton` per-bin
α_s computation.

| Config | Shape | ⟨Q²⟩ [GeV²] | A_bag (c = -0.012) | A_lat (c = -0.009) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| LOW | low_x | 5.92 | -0.3862 | -0.2896 |
| LOW | mid_x | 5.92 | -0.3178 | -0.2383 |
| LOW | high_x | 5.92 | -0.3913 | -0.2934 |
| MID | low_x | 7.38 | -0.3737 | -0.2803 |
| MID | mid_x | 7.38 | -0.3100 | -0.2325 |
| MID | high_x | 7.38 | -0.3875 | -0.2907 |
| TOP | low_x | 10.26 | -0.3509 | -0.2632 |
| TOP | mid_x | 10.26 | -0.2968 | -0.2226 |
| TOP | high_x | 10.26 | -0.3814 | -0.2861 |

`|A_bag| / |A_lat| = 0.012 / 0.009 = 4/3 = 1.333` exactly, holding across all
18 entries. A varies less than 5% across configs, confirming the Choice-2
physics (§5, point 8).

*Note: these A values are raw `scale` parameters (dimensionless multipliers in
the Δ formula). See §4.1 for conversion to peak Δ/F₁ ≈ 1.6×10⁻² (bag) and
≈ 1.2×10⁻² (lattice) for the mid_x shape reference at ⟨Q²⟩ = 7.4 GeV².*

---

## 4. Reach summary (A_bag values)

Significance σ² scales as `A²`, so the lattice entries give σ² × (3/4)² = σ² × 9/16
of the bag values; `L_5σ` scales as the inverse, i.e. ×16/9 ≈ 1.78× larger.

| Config | Shape | σ²/(fb⁻¹) | δA/A @ 10 fb⁻¹ | δA/A @ 100 fb⁻¹ | L_5σ [fb⁻¹/u] |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| LOW | low_x | 2895 | 0.0059 | 0.0019 | 0.01 |
| LOW | mid_x | 1516 | 0.0081 | 0.0026 | 0.02 |
| LOW | high_x | 714 | 0.0118 | 0.0037 | 0.03 |
| MID | low_x | 3535 | 0.0053 | 0.0017 | 0.01 |
| MID | mid_x | 1339 | 0.0086 | 0.0027 | 0.02 |
| MID | high_x | 472 | 0.0145 | 0.0046 | 0.05 |
| TOP | low_x | 2400 | 0.0065 | 0.0020 | 0.01 |
| TOP | mid_x | 433 | 0.0152 | 0.0048 | 0.06 |
| TOP | high_x | 85 | 0.0343 | 0.0108 | 0.29 |

**Worst case:** TOP + high_x, `L_5σ ≈ 0.29` fb⁻¹/u. At nominal EIC
luminosity (3.6 pb⁻¹/nucleon/hour) that is about 80 hours — well under a
year's run. Under the lattice sum rule (`c = -0.009`), all nine cases still
reach 5σ within a 1-year (10 fb⁻¹) program.

### Analytic rescaling of δA/A across (scale, luminosity)

Because A_cos2φ,bin scales linearly with s (through Δ ∝ s) and N_bin scales
linearly with luminosity L, the combined significance-squared has a
closed-form dependence on both variables. This lets the code compute σ²_ref
once per (config, shape) at reference (s = S₀ = 10⁻³, L = 1 fb⁻¹/nucleon)
and rescale analytically for every point on the plot — saving ~99% of the
compute cost compared to re-evaluating per (s, L) combination.

The scaling relation for the combined significance-squared is:

    σ²(s, L) = σ²_ref · (s / S₀)² · L                                  (10a)

where σ²_ref is computed once at reference values s = S₀ = 10⁻³ and
L = 1 fb⁻¹/nucleon. The resulting fractional asymmetry uncertainty is:

    δA/A (s, L) = 1 / √σ²(s, L)
               = 1 / √[ σ²_ref · (s/S₀)² · L ]                         (11)

This is what enables the plotting code to compute 9 curves × 15 scale
points × 2 luminosities from a single σ² evaluation per (config, shape) —
the analytic rescaling costs zero additional physics computation.

### 4.1 Note on x-axis convention (peak Δ/F₁ vs scale parameter s)

**Internal vs. displayed quantity.** The code uses `scale` (equivalently `s`)
internally as the multiplier in the Δ model:

    Δ(x, Q²) = scale · α_s(Q²) · F₁(x, Q²) · x^α · (1−x)^β

However, Plots 1-4 display **peak Δ/F₁** on the x-axis, defined as:

    peak Δ/F₁ = scale × α_s(⟨Q²⟩) × max_x[ x^α (1−x)^β ]

where the maximum of the shape factor and ⟨Q²⟩ are both evaluated for the
reference shape and config (mid_x + MID for the 9-curve plots). The internal
SCALES range [0.02, 2.0] therefore corresponds to displayed peak Δ/F₁ values
in the range [10⁻³, 10⁻¹].

**Conversion factor for the mid_x reference (MID config, ⟨Q²⟩ = 7.4 GeV²).**
The shape x^0.7 (1−x)^3 peaks at x_peak = 0.19 with a peak value of ≈ 0.170.
With α_s(7.4 GeV²) ≈ 0.30, the conversion factor is:

    α_s(⟨Q²⟩) × peak_shape = 0.30 × 0.170 = 0.051

**Converted vertical-line positions** (mid_x shape, MID config):

| Theory input | Raw |A| (= scale) | peak Δ/F₁ |
|---|---|---|
| Bag (Sather–Schmidt, c = −0.012) | 0.310 | 0.310 × 0.051 = **1.6 × 10⁻²** |
| Lattice (Detmold–Shanahan, c = −0.009) | 0.233 | 0.233 × 0.051 = **1.2 × 10⁻²** |

**Caveats.**

1. *Q² dependence of peak Δ/F₁.* Because α_s runs, peak Δ/F₁ is not a single
   number across the accepted Q² range — it varies by roughly a factor of 2
   (α_s(2 GeV²) ≈ 0.36 vs α_s(100 GeV²) ≈ 0.19). The vertical-line positions
   use the rate-weighted ⟨Q²⟩ as the reference.

2. *Shape dependence in 9-curve plots.* The peak of x^α(1−x)^β differs across
   the three shape variants (low_x, mid_x, high_x). Plots 1 and 2 show all
   nine (config, shape) combinations; the vertical dashed lines use the mid_x
   shape as the reference and note this in an on-plot annotation. The underlying
   curves are computed for their own shapes.

3. *Plots 3 and 4 are exact.* These plots use only the mid_x shape throughout,
   so the conversion factor (0.051) applies exactly to all displayed quantities.

**Why this matters.** Without the conversion, plotting |A| on an axis labeled
"Δ/F₁" would imply peak Δ/F₁ ≈ 0.3 — roughly 20× larger than the physical
value. The displayed peak Δ/F₁ ~ 1–2 × 10⁻² correctly reflects that the
one-gluon-exchange tensor asymmetry is suppressed by α_s × (shape peak) ≈ 0.05
relative to the F₁-normalized amplitude. The reach numbers in the table above
(L_5σ, δA/A, etc.) are unaffected by this labeling change.

### 4.2 Statistical derivation and interpretation of δA_bin and the combined uncertainty

This subsection derives Eq. 5 and Eq. 6 from first principles and explains why
per-bin relative uncertainties `|δA_bin/A_bin|` can reach 10³ while the
combined `δA/A` is ~1%. The two quantities measure fundamentally different
things.

#### 4.2.1 Origin of the per-bin uncertainty δA_bin = √(2/N_bin)/P_zz (Eq. 5)

Eq. 5 is the statistical uncertainty from a **maximum-likelihood (ML) fit of the
per-bin azimuthal yield to a cos(2φ) modulation**. It is not derived from Eq. 4.
Eq. 4 is the theoretical prediction for A_cos2φ (Hoodbhoy–Jaffe–Manohar kinematic
formula); Eq. 5 is the statistical precision with which that amplitude can be
measured from N_bin detected events.

**Derivation.**

The φ-differential yield in a (x, Q², y) bin with N_bin events:

    dN/dφ = (N_bin / 2π) · [1 + P_zz · A_cos2φ · cos(2φ)]

Define the observed cos(2φ) amplitude B = P_zz · A_cos2φ. The ML estimator for B
from the individual event angles {φᵢ} is:

    B̂ = (2 / N_bin) · Σᵢ cos(2φᵢ)

In the small-modulation limit (|B| ≪ 1), the events are approximately uniformly
distributed in φ. The variance of B̂ is:

    Var(B̂) = (4 / N_bin²) · N_bin · ⟨cos²(2φ)⟩ = (4 / N_bin) · (1/2) = 2 / N_bin

Therefore δB = √(2/N_bin), and since B = P_zz · A_cos2φ:

    δA_cos2φ = δB / P_zz = √(2/N_bin) / P_zz                   (Eq. 5)

**Origin of each factor:**

| Factor | Source |
|---|---|
| √N_bin in denominator | Standard Poisson counting: N events reduce variance by 1/N. |
| Extra √2 in numerator | ⟨cos²(2φ)⟩ = 1/2 under uniform φ. Cosine fits use only half the information per event because sin and cos are orthogonal modes — only the projection onto cos(2φ) counts. |
| 1/P_zz | Tensor-polarization dilution. The measured modulation is B = P_zz · A_cos2φ; dividing by P_zz un-dilutes to recover A_cos2φ. |

**Caveats.**

1. *Non-uniform φ acceptance.* For a real detector with gaps or shadowed regions,
   ⟨cos²(2φ)⟩_det ≠ 1/2. The effective denominator changes and must be computed
   from the acceptance-weighted integral. The formula above assumes uniform
   coverage.

2. *Small-modulation assumption.* The derivation requires |B| = |P_zz · A_cos2φ| ≪ 1.
   For our kinematics |B| ≲ 0.02 (since |A_cos2φ| ≲ 0.03 and P_zz ≈ 0.27), so
   this is well satisfied.

#### 4.2.2 Combined uncertainty as a one-parameter Fisher fit

**Critical wrinkle.** A_cos2φ is not a single physical constant — it depends on
(x, Q², y) through Eq. 4. So the standard "combine N independent measurements of
the same quantity" formula does not directly apply. The correct procedure is a
**one-parameter fit**.

**Two distinct quantities** that the framework computes:

- **Total significance σ**: the test statistic for the hypothesis "Δ is nonzero,"
  combined across all kinematic bins. Given by Eq. 6.
- **Fitted amplitude ŝ ± δŝ**: the best-fit value of the overall scale parameter
  in the model Δ = s · [fixed shape terms], and its Fisher-information uncertainty.

**Derivation of the one-parameter fit.**

Assume Δ(x, Q²) = s · Δ_shape(x, Q²), where Δ_shape is the fixed reference shape
and s is the free parameter. Then A_cos2φ,bin(s) = s · A_bin,shape. The
log-likelihood for the per-bin measured amplitudes {A_bin,meas} is:

    ln L(s) = −½ · Σ_bins [(A_bin,meas − s · A_bin,shape)² / δA_bin²]

The ML estimator for s is:

    ŝ = Σ_bins [A_bin,meas · A_bin,shape / δA_bin²]
        ─────────────────────────────────────────────
        Σ_bins [A_bin,shape² / δA_bin²]

The Fisher information gives the uncertainty:

    1 / δŝ² = Σ_bins (A_bin,shape² / δA_bin²)

Using A_bin,shape = A_bin,cos2φ / s_true:

    s_true / δŝ = √[ Σ_bins (A_bin,cos2φ / δA_bin)² ] = σ      (Eq. 6)

**Conclusion.** σ = ŝ / δŝ is the signal-to-noise ratio on the fitted amplitude.
Equivalently:

    δA/A = δŝ / s_true = 1/σ = 1/N_σ                            (Eq. 7)

The "combined amplitude" is the free parameter of the one-parameter fit; its
uncertainty is what Fisher information gives when all bins are combined. The sum
in Eq. 6 is an **inverse-variance-weighted sum of squared per-bin
signal-to-noise ratios** — Fisher information is additive across independent bins.

#### 4.2.3 Per-bin vs combined uncertainty — why they differ so much

These are two distinct quantities that are easy to confuse.

**Per-bin relative uncertainty:** (δA/A)_bin = δA_bin / |A_bin|. Tells you how
well an individual bin measures the asymmetry in that bin alone. Varies dramatically
across the (x, Q²) grid because both δA_bin (set by N_bin) and A_bin (set by
kinematic factors) vary. This is what the right subpanel of Plots 5–8 shows.

**Combined relative uncertainty:** (δA/A)_combined = 1/σ = 1/N_σ. Tells you how
well the fitted amplitude is determined using all bins together. Much smaller than
per-bin ratios because Fisher information accumulates additively across bins.

**Numerical example (MID + mid_x + 10 fb⁻¹/nucleon):**

| Quantity | Value |
|---|---|
| Per-bin median \|δA/A\| | 0.35 |
| Combined δA/A | 0.0086 |
| Ratio (per-bin / combined) | ~41 |

The ratio ~41 corresponds to roughly √(1700) ≈ 41 effective bins contributing
with full weight to the Fisher information (out of 345 kinematic bins), each with
varying weight determined by (A_bin/δA_bin)².

**Wrong way to combine.** Taking the mean of per-bin |δA/A| ratios does NOT give
the combined uncertainty. That gives ~0.35, underestimating sensitivity by ~40× in
this case. The correct combined uncertainty uses inverse-variance weighting: square
the per-bin signal-to-noise ratios, sum, then take √ and invert (i.e., Eq. 6 → 7).

**Intuition.** Each bin contributes an independent "vote" of magnitude
(A_bin/δA_bin)² to the combined significance. Good bins (large |A|, small δA)
vote loudly; bad bins — those at large x + large Q² where signal is killed by
(1−x)^β and rate by 1/Q⁴ — whisper. The combined significance is the RMS-sum of
votes, dominated by the loud moderate-x, moderate-Q² bins.

#### 4.2.4 Significance ↔ relative uncertainty duality

From Eq. 7, σ = 1/(δA/A), so every significance value maps to a unique relative
statistical uncertainty on the fitted amplitude:

| σ (significance) | δA/A (relative stat uncertainty) |
|---|---|
| 1 | 100% |
| 2 | 50% |
| 3 | 33% |
| **5** | **20%** |
| 10 | 10% |
| 100 | 1% |

Same information, flipped: significance = signal/noise; relative uncertainty =
noise/signal.

**Precise statement for today's numbers.** σ = 5 means the fitted amplitude ŝ from
the one-parameter fit is 20% relatively uncertain. For the bag prediction
s_0^bag = 0.310 (mid_x shape, MID config), a 5σ result would report:

    ŝ = 0.310 ± 0.062   (statistical only)

**Two caveats.**

1. *Per-bin vs fitted amplitude.* The 5σ ↔ 20% mapping applies to the **fitted
   overall amplitude** ŝ, not to per-bin measurements. Per-bin uncertainties can
   be much larger (median 35% at 10 fb⁻¹) even when the combined uncertainty is
   small (0.86%).

2. *Discovery vs precision.* 5σ is the **discovery threshold**, not the
   **precision threshold**. At 5σ, δA/A = 20% is a loose measurement. For
   precision physics one wants 10σ (10%) or better, requiring 4× more luminosity
   (since σ ∝ √L). Today's numbers show that at 100 fb⁻¹/nucleon under the bag
   prediction, δA/A drops to ~0.6–1% (100σ+); the measurement becomes
   systematics-limited well before statistics run out.

   convention.

The statistical framework in §4.2 is standard HEP practice as documented in [1]
and [2]. The specific per-bin uncertainty formula δA_bin = √(2/N_bin)/P_zz
(Eq. 5) is the tensor-polarization-scaled version of the well-known cos(nφ)
amplitude uncertainty from [3, 4], applied to the double-helicity-flip observable
rather than to elliptic flow. The direct experimental precedent for a tensor DIS
asymmetry measurement is HERMES's b₁ analysis [5]; our machinery is essentially
the ⁶Li tensor gluonometry analog of that framework, projected forward to EIC
luminosities.

## 5. Per-bin heatmap diagnostics

The three-subpanel layout of Plots 5–8 shows `|A_bin|` (left), `δA_bin`
(middle), `|δA_bin/A_bin|` (right) as a function of (x, Q²). This decomposition
makes two failure modes visually distinct: signal suppression via `(1−x)^β`
at large x, and rate suppression from the 1/Q⁴ cross-section falloff at large
Q².

| Config | L [fb⁻¹] | \|A_bin\| min/med/max | δA_bin min/med/max | \|δA/A\| min/med/max | Max at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MID | 10 | 6.7e-5 / 1.2e-2 / 2.9e-2 | 1.1e-3 / 3.5e-3 / 0.84 | 4.5e-2 / 0.35 / 1.3e+4 | x=0.897, Q²=1379 GeV² |
| MID | 100 | 6.7e-5 / 1.2e-2 / 2.9e-2 | 3.4e-4 / 1.1e-3 / 0.27 | 1.4e-2 / 0.11 / 4.0e+3 | x=0.897, Q²=1379 GeV² |
| TOP | 10 | 1.4e-4 / 8.4e-3 / 2.7e-2 | 1.1e-3 / 4.3e-3 / 0.78 | 0.11 / 0.65 / 5.7e+3 | x=0.897, Q²=1776 GeV² |
| TOP | 100 | 1.4e-4 / 8.4e-3 / 2.7e-2 | 3.4e-4 / 1.3e-3 / 0.25 | 3.5e-2 / 0.21 / 1.8e+3 | x=0.897, Q²=1776 GeV² |

Large `|δA/A|` ratios are always at large x + large Q²: signal is killed by
`(1−x)^β` and rate is killed by 1/Q⁴. These bins contribute negligibly to the
combined sum (6); the combined reach is dominated by the moderate-x, moderate-Q²
region where both `A_bin` and N_bin are large.

## 6. Physics discussions from today's Q&A

These discussions clarify the theoretical context for the sum-rule normalization
and are recorded here for reference.

### 6.1 Bag model origin of Δ

MIT bag model: quarks confined in a ~1 fm spherical cavity, free Dirac
fermions inside with linear-boundary-condition BCs. In the pure parton model
(no gluons), helicity conservation forces Δ = 0. Sather and Schmidt (1993)
added one-gluon exchange to get non-zero Δ; the leading result is
`⟨x·Δ⟩ ~ α_s` at the bag scale. The bag calculation provides the only
published numerical estimate of the first moment of Δ.

### 6.2 "Gluonic probe" language

Δ has two gauge-invariant operator contributions at one-gluon order:
(a) the quark propagator with a gluon insertion (Sather–Schmidt captures this),
and (b) the two-gluon operator (gluon helicity flip). At small x the gluon
piece tends to dominate; at moderate x (around the peak of `x·F₁`) both
contributions are comparable. The current model includes only the quark piece
via the Sather–Schmidt moment.

### 6.3 Is 10⁻³ a lower bound on |A|?

No. The Sather–Schmidt value is a point estimate with an order-of-magnitude
theoretical uncertainty. The missing two-gluon piece could add to or cancel the
quark piece. No positivity theorem forces `|Δ|` above any particular floor.
The three-tier scenario (10⁻³, 3×10⁻³, 10⁻²) used in earlier notes is
narrative labeling — "modest gluon enhancement" and "optimistic gluon-dominated"
— not independent calculations.

### 6.4 Three-tier scenario (10⁻³, 3×10⁻³, 10⁻²)

Standard EIC projection labeling carried over from prior sessions. Only the
10⁻³ case has a calculation behind it (Sather–Schmidt bag). The 3× and 10×
tiers are scenario labels. The sum-rule normalization of today's work supersedes
this ad-hoc scan and grounds the normalization in the physical first moment.

### 6.5 State of existing Δ calculations

Very thin. Hoodbhoy–Jaffe–Manohar (NPB 312:571): foundational operator
analysis, no numerics. Sather–Schmidt (1993): bag model, the only published
number for `⟨x·Δ⟩`. Detmold–Shanahan: lattice QCD, provides the second
numerical estimate used here (`c = -0.009`). No experimental measurement of Δ
exists.

### 6.6 Toy x-shape motivation

`x^α(1−x)^β` is a Regge-inspired small-x template (α controls the small-x
power) combined with Brodsky–Farrar quark-counting large-x suppression (β
controls the large-x falloff). This template is not Δ-specific; it is the
standard ansatz for any parton distribution. All three current variants have
positive α, meaning they miss the gluon-dominated scenario where Δ could be
rising more steeply at small x.

### 6.7 First-moment constraint as normalization

The sum rule `∫x·Δ dx = c·α_s` replaces the arbitrary "peak Δ/F₁ = scale"
normalization with a physically-motivated amplitude derived from the shape
integral over F₁. This reduces the normalization freedom from a free parameter
to the fixed c coefficient (known from bag or lattice), leaving only the x-shape
as a free parameter. Factor-of-order-2 shape systematic remains (high_x vs
low_x cases in §4).

### 6.8 Choice 2: placing α_s inside Δ

Putting α_s(Q²) inside Δ (equation 1) rather than treating it as a global
prefactor means that when the sum-rule constraint is enforced (equation 2),
α_s appears on both sides and cancels in equation (3). The result is that A
is a single constant across Q² bins. This matches physical intuition — the
tensor asymmetry amplitude should not run strongly with Q² if it is fully
determined by the sum-rule normalization and the shape. The ~5% residual
variation observed in §3 is purely from F₁ evolution.

### 6.9 5σ threshold and δA/A = 0.20

`δA/A = 1/N_σ` by definition (equation 7). Setting N_σ = 5 gives
`(δA/A)_{5σ} = 0.20`. The value 5 is the HEP convention for "discovery"
significance. A measurement achieving `δA/A = 0.20` is a discovery-level
constraint on Δ at the assumed sum-rule value.

---

## 7. Key physics conclusions

1. **Sum-rule normalization improves reach by ~1000× vs peak-Δ/F₁ scan.**
   Under the bag or lattice sum-rule prediction, discovery-time becomes
   "hours to days" rather than "years to decades."

2. **All 9 (config, shape) combinations reach 5σ within 1 year (10 fb⁻¹).**
   Worst case is TOP + high_x at `L_5σ ≈ 0.29` fb⁻¹/u (~80 hours at nominal
   EIC instantaneous luminosity). Under the lattice constraint, the worst case
   is still comfortably within a 1-year program.

3. **A ≈ constant across configs (< 5% variation).** Confirms Choice-2 physics:
   α_s cancels and A is set by the shape integral over F₁. The residual variation
   is from F₁ evolution alone.

4. **|A_bag|/|A_lat| = 4/3 exactly** from the c-coefficient ratio (0.012/0.009).
   The two theoretical inputs agree in sign and are close in magnitude; the ratio
   is fixed by the calculation, not the simulation.

5. **At 100 fb⁻¹, the measurement becomes systematics-limited** (δA/A ~
   0.5–1%). The statistical reach is no longer the bottleneck. Next priorities
   are P_zz calibration, F₂A normalization, radiative corrections, and
   shape-model systematic control.

6. **Per-bin decomposition clarifies failure modes.** Large `|δA/A|` at large x +
   large Q² comes from combined signal suppression (`(1−x)^β`) and rate
   suppression (1/Q⁴). These bins are negligible in the combined sum (6).

## 8. Updated next-steps ranking

Building on §4 of `money_delta_note_2026-07-16.md` and §4 of `2026-07-20.md`:

### Tier A — physics inputs on the critical path

1. **Resolve ⁶Li P_zz dilution convention** (unchanged from 2026-07-16 §4 #1,
   elevated in urgency). Under sum-rule normalization, P_zz uncertainty directly
   limits achievable δA/A at 100 fb⁻¹. Consult I. Cloet or nuclear-structure
   literature. A factor ~1.5 in `P_zz_eff` → factor ~2.3 in σ² → factor ~1.5
   in `L_5σ`. See 2026-07-16 §7 for the full convention discussion.

2. **Anchor Δ(x, Q²) to a real theory calculation** (sharpened from 2026-07-16
   §4 #2). Sum-rule normalization reduces shape systematic but does not eliminate
   it — factor ~2 remains across the three shape variants. Options: lattice-moment
   constraints, CDKS convolution model, NJL or light-cone model. Minimum viable:
   one motivated shape with its own uncertainty estimate.

3. **(Retired per 2026-07-20)** Nuclear PDF choice sub-1%; not a priority.
   EPPS21 is sufficient for current projections.

4. **NEW: Systematic-uncertainty studies now on the critical path.** With
   statistics no longer limiting at 10–100 fb⁻¹, the priority shifts to:
   P_zz calibration uncertainty, F₂A normalization uncertainty, radiative
   corrections, and x-shape modeling systematic. These dominate the achievable
   precision at high luminosity.

### Tier B — detector and reconstruction realism

5. η-dependent electron-ID efficiency (real ePIC curve, once stable).
6. Detector resolution smearing on E′ and θ; bin migration in (x, Q², φ).
7. Radiative corrections (HECTOR-equivalent).

### Tier C — long-term

8. NNLO QCD corrections to the DIS cross section.
9. Target-mass corrections at high x.
10. Polarized-electron scenarios (complementary single-spin and A_LT observables).

## 11. Bottom line

Under the bag (`c = -0.012`) or lattice (`c = -0.009`) first-moment sum-rule
prediction, ⁶Li tensor gluonometry is discoverable at 5σ significance in
hours to days across all tested (config, shape) combinations. The physics case
transforms from "requires a decade of running" to "systematics-limited within
a year." The two remaining priorities now on the critical path are:

1. **P_zz convention resolution** — the unresolved dilution factor is the
   largest single ambiguity in the achievable δA/A at high luminosity.
2. **Systematic-uncertainty control** — P_zz calibration, F₂A normalization,
   radiative corrections, and shape modeling all become leading uncertainties
   once δA/A drops below ~1%.
